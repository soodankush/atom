## About Assigment

### Objective

Create an API for a book rental service that allows users to search for books, rent books for a
maximum of 2 weeks, return books, view rental history, automatically mark rentals as
overdue, and send email notifications for overdue rentals.
Design
This is a backend task so no frontend is required, although the solution must be implemented
in such a way that it could be integrated into a full stack application. The model/database
design and table structure are yours to decide. Appropriate validation is expected.

### Requirements

1. Search for Books by name and or genre
2. Rent a Book
3. Return a Book
4. View Rental History
5. Mark Overdue Rentals: Automatically mark rentals as overdue if not returned
   within 2 weeks.
6. Email Notifications: Send an email notification to users when their rentals become
   overdue.
7. Stats to show the most overdue book, most popular and least popular
